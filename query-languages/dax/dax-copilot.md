# Write DAX queries with Copilot

You can use Copilot to write and explain Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries in DAX query view of a Power BI semantic model. 

## Enable Copilot

Check to make sure you meet the [Fabric Copilot requirements](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview#enable-copilot). 

### Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, in the **Preview features** section of the **Options**, enable **DAX query view with Copilot**.

1. Open Power BI Desktop.
1. Open an existing Power BI report or connect to published semantic model as live edit or live connection. Alternatively, you can add data and create a new semantic model and report.
1. Go to **DAX query view**, the fourth view available on the left side of Power BI Desktop.
1. Create a new query tab.
1. Open Copilot by clicking on the **Copilot** button or using <kbd>CTRL + I</kbd>.

### Power BI service or workspace

1. Choose a published semantic model in a workspace.
2. From the context menu choose **Write DAX queries**. If **Write DAX queries** is greyed out, you may need to enable **Users can edit data models in the Power BI service (preview)** in the **Power BI** **General** section of **Workspace settings**.
3. Create a new query tab.
4. Open Copilot by clicking on the Copilot button or using <kbd>CTRL + I</kbd>.

> [!NOTE]
> DirectQuery and Direct Lake model authors can also use DAX query view. View the data in your tables whenever you want.

## Use Copilot

Let’s look at what Copilot can help you with in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

- **Natural language to DAX query**. Just ask for what you want from your semantic model and have the DAX query generated by Copilot. You can also select an existing DAX query and have Copilot modify it.
- **DAX query to natural language**. Ask Copilot to explain what any DAX query is doing. 
- **Understand DAX concepts**. Maybe you heard about a certain DAX function or need to find the right DAX function for the job. Copilot can help you here too.  

To use Copilot to create a DAX query, type in a prompt to describe what DAX query you would like generated and select **Send** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Alternatively, you can click the **Write DAX query** inspire button. To run what is returned, select **Run** or press <kbd>F5</kbd> to see the results of the DAX query. To keep the query and exit Copilot, select **Keep query** to add it to query tab. 

To use Copilot to explain a DAX query, select the DAX query and click the **Explain this query** inspire button. A short explanation is shown with the option to **show more** to see a longer explanation. 

To use Copilot to explain a DAX topic, click the **Explain a DAX topic** inspire button, or type in a prompt to ask for an explanation of a DAX function or topic and select **Send** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A short explanation is shown with the option to **show more** to see a longer explanation. 

## Features of the inline Copilot

### 1. Run the DAX query before you keep it

You can **Run** the DAX query then decide to **Keep** or **Discard** the DAX query. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/copilot-run-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of running the DAX query before you save it.":::

### 2. Build the DAX query conversationally

After the initial DAX query is generated, you can simply adjust by typing in additional user prompts. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/copilot-explain-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of asking DAX to explain the query."::: 

### 3. Syntax checks on the generated DAX query

The generated DAX query syntax is checked, and the prompt automatically retried once. If the retry is also invalid, the generated DAX query is returned with a note that there is an issue, giving you the option to rephrase your request or fix the generated DAX query:

"This query contains errors. Rephrase your request and try again or try fixing it yourself."

### 4. Inspire buttons to get you started with Copilot
 
Type in a prompt or select any of these buttons to see quickly what you can do with Copilot.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/copilot-inspire-buttons-get-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot of showing Copilot offers suggestions."::: 

## Sample prompts

Here is a collection of sample prompts to illustrate how to get Copilot to write the DAX queries you want.

- [List products and show the last three months' profit compared to the previous three months](#list-products-and-show-the-last-three-months-profit-compared-to-the-previous-three-months).
- [Add a column to show the difference](#add-a-column-to-show-the-difference).
- [Explain what this query does](#explain-what-this-query-does).
- [What is SUMMARIZECOLUMNS used for](#what-is-summarizecolumns-used-for).

### List products and show the last three months' profit compared to the previous three months

In a blank query tab, invoke Copilot with <kbd>CTRL+I</kbd> and enter this request:

"list the products and show the last 3 months profit compared to the 3 months before."

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-list-products.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing list products and show last 3 months profit compared to the 3 months before." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-list-products.png":::

After a few moments I get a detailed DAX query. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-query-list-products.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing DAX query generated by Fabric Copilot." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-query-list-products.png":::

I select **Keep query** and then **Run** the query. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-updated-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Run DAX query generated by Fabric Copilot." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-updated-query.png":::  

Let's see the difference between the last three months and the previous three months. Select the query and start Copilot again with <kbd>CTRL+I</kbd>, or select the ribbon button. 

### Add a column to show the difference 

This time the selection is showing fitted to the text and the background shading highlights what is being sent with the request to Copilot. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-show-diff.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Run the query that calculated the profit." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-show-diff.png":::

Now the diff styling in the DAX query editor shows exactly what Copilot has changed.  

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-highlight-diff.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Diff styling shows what Copilot has changed." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-highlight-diff.png":::

I select **Keep query** and **Run** it again. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-updated-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Run the query and see the results, with the Profit Difference column." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-updated-query.png":::

I see the DAX query, and I can see the requests I sent to Copilot at the top of the query. Each main block of the query is also commented, explaining what it’s doing in each part.

Maybe those comments aren't working for me. Let’s get a full explanation.  

### Explain what this query does 

Again, highlight the whole query and invoke Copilot with this request:

"Explain to me what this query does."

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Explain to me what this query does." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-query.png":::

Now, instead of writing DAX queries, it’s responding in the in-line window.  

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-query-explanation.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing brief explanation of the query.":::

Copilot generates a few lines. I select **Show more** to see the full explanation.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-query-more.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a long explanation of what the query does.":::

Now I understand each part and the DAX functions used.  

### What is SUMMARIZECOLUMNS used for?

Speaking of these DAX functions, it would be great to get an explanation of those too. Let’s try Copilot to  get some more information about a specific DAX function. 

 In this request, let’s find out what the SUMMARIZECOLUMNS does. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-summarize-columns.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an explanation of what the SUMMARIZECOLUMNS does." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-summarize-columns.png":::

Again, Copilot generates brief description: 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-summarize-columns-brief.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a brief description of the SUMMARIZECOLUMNS DAX funtion.":::

I select **Show more**. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-summarize-columns-more.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Copilot generates a much more in-depth description.":::

Because I asked Copilot in the context of a DAX query that I highlighted, it gave me the response in the context of that query as well.
